# Bachelorproject

In this repository are the main files used in the bachelorproject: 
"Constraining the mass-loss rates of radio-emitting low-mass
stars"

File execution in order:
*start with csv file of the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue: "SRSC_filtered.csv"*

-GaiaSimbadreadradiostars.py

-calcMassRadius.py

either -FluxRadiostars.py for mass-loss rate constraints 
or -FreqRadiostars.py for analysing grid parameters

-repeat FluxRadiostars.py if you want to apply better grid parameters and use the initially computed values

There are other files, which serve to show how most of the plots have been made.
